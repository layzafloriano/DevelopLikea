Due to the lack of female representativity in the tech community, we decided to develop a community for female developers. In this website, the women are able to sign up, login, edit their profile, add posts, check the community’s posts on their feed, register job openings, check job openings, register events, check the community’s events, check the event's location on Google Maps, check the site’s database, as in the users of the website and through this list, check their profile.

## Developed with
* Node.js
* Express.js
* Handlebars
* CSS
* Google Maps API
* Middlewares

**Thank you for checking our community out!**
